h1. term-workspace

This app is designed to simplify your life.

It's common, that a user starts an fixed set of apps in fixed set of terminal windows. 

For example, when I work with rails app I open two windows. First, the large one I use for
editors, command line and rails console. The second one I use to start local server and
some tasks, such as autotest. So I when got tied to open the same windows each time, 
I've created this app.

It's a command line tool. After you install it you can run it with keys:

h2. Profile example

<pre><code>basedir "~/rails-apps/simple-blog" # basedir for the project
  add_window do |wo|     # the first window, user will interact here
    wo.basedir  = "."               # the same dir, or change it, if you like
    wo.profile  = "Default"         # Terminal profile, Go MainMenu->Edit->Profiles in your gnome-terminal to setup it.
    wo.geometry = "165x57+0+0"      # Large window окно, at left-top

      to.command = 'vim'
    end
    wo.add_tab do |to|              # editor №2 
      to.command = 'vim'
      to.dir = 'app'
    end
    wo.add_tab do |to|              # editor №3 rspec
      to.command = 'vim'
